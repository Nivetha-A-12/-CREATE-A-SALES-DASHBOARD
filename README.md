TASK DESCRIPTION:
 I designed and developed a complete interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Desktop. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights through data visualization and analytical storytelling. I used Power BI Desktop as the main tool throughout this task. It offered a powerful environment to import, clean, model, and visualize data in a structured and user-friendly way. To prepare the dataset, I worked extensively within the Power Query Editor, where I performed data transformation tasks such as filtering unnecessary rows, renaming columns, changing data types, and removing duplicates. I also used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures and calculated columns that added dynamic behavior to my report. I used EXcel data for this task which contained details about a superamrket sales data. I started by loading the dataset into Power BI. Using Power Query, I cleaned and shaped the data this involved tasks like removing blank rows, fixing inconsistent values, and ensuring proper formatting. I also standardized field names and created new columns where necessary for better analysis. After cleaning, I set up relationships between different tables to form a well-structured star schema model. This allowed me to use filters, slicers, and visuals across different dimensions without redundancy or conflict. I ensured the model was efficient, accurate, and logically consistent. To add depth to my dashboard, I created several calculated measures using DAX. For example, I implemented calculations like total sales, percentage change, average values, and key performance indicators (KPIs). These helped me track business metrics effectively across different dimensions. I created a variety of visuals that were both insightful and easy to interpret.I arranged the visuals on a clean, user-friendly layout using Power BI's formatting tools. I ensured the use of consistent color themes and fonts to maintain readability.
The dashboard I created can be applied in real-world business environments such as Sales Analysis ,Marketing Campaign Monitoring,Finance and Budgeting,Operations Management , etc.

In short, this type of dashboard is highly valuable in any business scenario where decision-making is driven by real-time data and visual insights.
